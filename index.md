# What is Scopul?

Scopul is a python package to extract data from midi files. It can extract things such as note duration, velocity, tempo and time signature. It also has additional 
features such as converting a midi into a pdf or MusicXML file. For information about how to use it, check the table of contents below:

# Why was Scopul made?
The aim of Scopul was to be a personal educational project that delved into the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, packaging, documentation, and docstrings. Furthermore, it aimed to provide a simple solution for MIDI file extraction, as I discovered that many available libraries were either complicated or offered a wide range of functionality not specifically related to MIDI files, making it challenging to understand and utilize if you only required a basic MIDI analyzer.

Scopul was built using the Music21 library, which provides much more extensive functionality. If Scopul fails to fulfill your requirements, I strongly suggest checking out Music21.
