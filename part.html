# Part

## Overview
Part is a class to fetch seperate parts of a <a href="scopul.html">Scopul</a> object (ie. flute part, piano part). It provides 3 properties: `part`, `name`, `sequence` and 8 methods: `get_notes()`, `get_note_count()`, `get_rests()`, `get_rest_count()`, `get_chords()`, `get_chord_count()`,`get_measure()`, `get_highest_note()`

Here's an example of how to get a Part object from a Scopul instance:

```python
scop = Scopul("test.mid")

# Get all the parts
parts = scop.parts
# parts = [<Sequence.Part object at 0x000001C8065EBCD0>] **this list can be longer

# Get sample flute part
flute_part = parts[0]
print(flue_part)

# Sample output
>>> <Sequence.Part object at 0x000001C8065EBCD0>
```
<br>
## Properties

- `name`
    - Retrieves the name specified in th emidi file for this perticular part
    - Returns
        - A str, representing the part name. For example:`"Clarinet"`
    
    - Example:
        ```python
        scop = Scopul("test.mid")

        # Getting parts
        parts = scop.parts

        # Select a random part
        random_part = parts[0]
        print(random_part.name)

        # Sample output
        >>> "Piano"
        ```

    - Can be used to find a certain part in a midi by iterating through it. For example:
        ```python
        scop = Scopul("test.mid")

        # Getting parts
        parts = scop.parts

        # Lets say we want a flute part
        flute_part = None

        # Iterate through the parts
        for part in parts:
            # Check if its the flute part
            if part.name == "Flute"
                flute_part = part
                break
        ```
<br>

- `sequence`
    - Retrieves the sequence of rests, notes and chords played in the part
    - Returns
        - A list consisting of <a href="note.html">Note</a>, <a href="rest.html">Rest</a>, and <a href="chord.html">Chord</a> objects 

    - Example
        ```python
        scop = Scopul("test.mid")

        # Getting parts
        parts = scop.parts

        # Select a random part
        random_part = parts[0]
        print(random_part.sequence)

        # Sample output
        >>>[<Sequence.Chord object at 0x0000022DEED33390>, <Sequence.Rest object at 0x0000022DEED34FD0>, <Sequence.Note object at 0x0000022DEECCEF10>, <Sequence.Note object at 0x0000022DEECCC910>, <Sequence.Note object at 0x0000022DEECDC450>]
        ```
<br>

- `part`
    - Retrieves a [Music21 stream part object](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_06_stream2.html)

    - Example
        ```python
        scop = Scopul("test.mid")

        # Getting parts
        parts = scop.parts

        # Select a random part
        random_part = parts[0]

        print(random_part.part)

        # Sample output
        >>> <music21.stream.Part 0x1e345fd0a50>
        ```
